Fourier-inspired neural module for real-time and full-color computer-generated holography

## Update
We further implement Fourier-inspired neural module for full-color computer-generated holography. You can find codes [here](https://github.com/Zhenxing-Dong/Fourier-inspired-neural-module/tree/master/Full-color).

The previous codes, which are published in the [Optics Letters](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-48-3-759), can be found in [here](https://github.com/Zhenxing-Dong/Fourier-inspired-neural-module/tree/master/OL).
